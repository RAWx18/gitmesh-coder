## Setting up a Development Environment

### Create a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to create a virtual environment outside of the repository to keep your development environment isolated.

#### Using `venv` (Python 3.9 and later)

```
python -m venv /path/to/venv
```

### Activate the Virtual Environment

#### On Windows

```
/path/to/venv/Scripts/activate
```

#### On Unix or macOS

```
source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
```

### Install the Project in Editable Mode

This step allows you to make changes to the source code and have them take effect immediately without reinstalling the package.

```
pip install -e .
```

### Install the Project Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For development, at least install the development dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements/requirements-dev.txt
```

Consider installing other optional dependencies from the `requirements/` directory, if your development work needs them. 

Note that these dependency files are generated by `./scripts/pip-compile.sh` and then committed. See [Managing Dependencies](#managing-dependencies).

### Handy Opinionated Setup Commands for MacOS / Linux

Here's an example of following the setup instructions above, for your copy/paste pleasure if your system works the same. Start in the project directory.

```
python3 -m venv ../aider_venv \
 && source ../aider_venv/bin/activate \
 && pip3 install -e . \
 && pip3 install -r requirements.txt \
 && pip3 install -r requirements/requirements-dev.txt
```
